:mod:`numkit` --- Helper functions for scipy and friends

A collection of functions and classes that support the analysis of molecular
dynamics trajectories (i.e. mostly time series). Because these functions could
conceivably be useful in other contexts as well they were moved into a separate
package with a very permissive licence.

Please note that these functions are provided "as is" and no guarantee is given
that they are accurate or free from error. Bug reports and test cases are very
welcome. Please submit them through the Github `Issue Tracker`_.

The following modules are available and can be imported when needed:

:mod:`numkit.fitting`
   Simple least square fitting routines.

:mod:`numkit.timeseries`
   Analysing time series (including correlation functions and coarse
   graining)

:mod:`numkit.integration`
   Numerical integration of data (e.g. integration with error bars)

:mod:`numkit.observables`
   Defines an object :class:`~numkit.observables.QuantityWithError`
   that automatically performs simple error propagation arithmetic.
