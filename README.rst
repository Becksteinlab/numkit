**numkit** is a small collection of numerical helper functions and
classes ("numerical first aid kit") that have been useful for
GromacsWrapper_ and related projects.

Originally, **numkit** was part of GromacsWrapper_ but was split off
into its own small package in version 0.7.0 of GromacsWrapper.
